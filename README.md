This is a fork of the viseo module to use a simplify version for STT.

Source is here: https://github.com/NGRP/node-red-contrib-viseo

This package have some update of library and differ from the original work. You don't need to have a key to removed a message for collecting data.
Mhy principal motivation is to have a simple node to works with the STT and TTS from google with my project wazo-platform.
